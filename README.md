EPL Code Snippet Library
========================

This is a community-maintained repository of code snippets that help modify the default behaviour of [Easy Property Listings](https://easypropertylistings.com.au/).

Snippets are organised into categories (folders) and each snippet is placed in its own file with a name that describes what it does.

## Using Snippets

Most files in this library are set up to be WordPress plugins:

1. Click on the filename of the snippet you'd like to use.
2. Click the "Raw" button (next to "Blame" and "History") at the top right.
3. Save the page from your browser to your wp-content/plugins folder and upload to your server. Alternatively you can compress the file as a .zip file and upload as a plugin from within WordPress. 
4. Activate the plugin from the WordPress plugins page.

For files that aren't set up as plugins follow steps 1 and 2 above and then copy and paste the code into your child theme's functions.php or place inside a custom functionality plugin.

If you need help customising any of the snippets or do not understand how to use them, we recommend [Advanced Development](https://easypropertylistings.com.au/extensions/advanced-development/).

## Submitting Your Snippet

We welcome and encourage everyone to submit their code snippets. If you would like to submit your snippet, please [fork](https://github.com/easypropertylistings/library/fork) the repository and then create a [pull request](https://github.com/easydigitaldownloads/library/compare/).

Please refer to the [Contributing guidelines](https://github.com/easypropertylistings/library/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting your pull request.

## Proposing a Snippet

If there is a snippet you are unable to find and would like to propose get written, please open an [issue](https://github.com/easypropertylistings/library/issues) and describe your need.

## Notes

This is not a tutorial archive. Please see the [tutorials section](https://easypropertylistings.com.au/category/tutorial/) of the EPL website if you're looking for instructions on how to implement these snippets (and others).

These snippets come with no guarantees. Due to the constant evolution of the EPL codebase, it is possible that the behaviour of these snippets may change overtime. Find something broken? [Let us know](https://github.com/easypropertylistings/library/issues)!
